It allows easy recovery of various kinds of passwords by sniffing the network, cracking encrypted passwords using Dictionary, Brute-Force and Cryptanalysis attacks, recording VoIP conversations, decoding scrambled passwords, recovering wireless network keys, revealing password boxes, uncovering cached passwords and analyzing routing protocols.</p><p>The latest version is faster and contains a lot of new features like APR (ARP Poison Routing) which enables sniffing on switched LANs and Man-in-the-Middle attacks. The sniffer in this version can also analyze encrypted protocols such as SSH-1 and HTTPS and contains filters to capture credentials from a wide range of authentication mechanisms. The new version also ships routing protocols authentication monitors and routes extractors, dictionary and brute-force crackers for all common hashing algorithms and for several specific authentications, password/hash calculators, cryptanalysis attacks, password decoders and some not so common utilities related to network and system security.</p><h2>Who Should Use This Tool?</h2><p>The objective of this exercise was to use the various password cracking tools available in the Cain and Abel software application and to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of each technique. The following user accounts were created for testing purposes. Cain & Abel is a popular password cracking tool. This tool is developed to intercept network traffic and then discover passwords by bruteforcing the password using cryptanalysis attack methods. It can also recover wireless network keys by analyzing routing protocols.</p><p>Cain &amp; Abel is a tool that will be quite useful for network administrators, teachers, professional penetration testers, security consultants/professionals, forensic staff and security software vendors.</p><h2>Requirements</h2><img src='https://tr2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2016/08/11/3493e9bc-df87-4453-8561-244f9773cbe9/cainandabel.png' alt='Crack' title='Crack'><p>The system requirements needed to successfully setup Cain &amp; Abel are:</p><ul><li>At least 10MB hard disk space</li><li>Microsoft Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista OS</li><li>Winpcap Packet Driver (v2.3 or above)</li><li>Airpcap Packet Driver (for passive wireless sniffer / WEP cracker)</li></ul><h2>Installation</h2><p>First we need to download Cain &amp; Abel, so go to the download page <span>www.oxid.it/cain.html</span>. </p><p>After downloading it, just run the Self-Installing executable package and follow the installation instructions.</p><h2>Cain’s Features</h2><p>Here’s a list of all of Cain’s features that make it a great tool for network penetration testing:</p><table border='0'><tbody valign='top'><tr><td>Protected Storage Password Manager</td><td>Credential Manager Password Decoder</td></tr><tr><td>LSA Secrets Dumper</td><td>Dialup Password Decoder</td></tr><tr><td>Service Manager</td><td>APR (ARP Poison Routing)</td></tr><tr><td>Route Table Manager</td><td>Network Enumerator</td></tr><tr><td>SID Scanner</td><td>Remote Registry</td></tr><tr><td>Sniffer</td><td>Routing Protocol Monitors</td></tr><tr><td>Full RDP sessions sniffer for APR</td><td>Full SSH-1 sessions sniffer for APR</td></tr><tr><td>Full HTTPS sessions sniffer for APR</td><td>Full FTPS sessions sniffer for APR</td></tr><tr><td>Full POP3S sessions sniffer for APR</td><td>Full IMAPS sessions sniffer for APR</td></tr><tr><td>Full LDAPS sessions sniffer for APR</td><td>Certificates Collector</td></tr><tr><td>MAC Address Scanner with OUI fingerprint</td><td>Promiscuous-mode Scanner</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless Scanner</td><td>PWL Cached Password Decoder</td></tr><tr><td>802.11 Capture Files Decoder</td><td>Password Crackers</td></tr><tr><td>Access (9x/2000/XP) Database Passwords Decoder</td><td>Cryptanalysis attacks</td></tr><tr><td>Base64 Password Decoder</td><td>WEP Cracker</td></tr><tr><td>Cisco Type-7 Password Decoder</td><td>Rainbowcrack-online client</td></tr><tr><td>Cisco VPN Client Password Decoder</td><td>Enterprise Manager Password Decoder</td></tr><tr><td>RSA SecurID Token Calculator</td><td>Hash Calculator</td></tr><tr><td>TCP/UDP Table Viewer</td><td>TCP/UDP/ICMP Traceroute</td></tr><tr><td>Cisco Config Downloader/Uploader (SNMP/TFTP)</td><td>Box Revealer</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless Zero Configuration Password Dumper</td><td>Remote Desktop Password Decoder</td></tr><tr><td>MSCACHE Hashes Dumper</td><td>MySQL Password Extractor</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Password Extractor</td><td>Oracle Password Extractor</td></tr><tr><td>VNC Password Decoder</td><td>Syskey Decoder</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Related Definitions</h2><p><strong>MAC</strong>: (from<strong> Wikipedia)</strong> “A Media Access Control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment. MAC addresses are used for numerous network technologies and most IEEE 802 network technologies, including Ethernet. Logically, MAC addresses are used in the Media Access Control protocol sub-layer of the OSI reference model.</p><p>MAC addresses are most often assigned by the manufacturer of a network interface card (NIC) and are stored in its hardware, the card’s read-only memory, or some other firmware mechanism. If assigned by the manufacturer, a MAC address usually encodes the manufacturer’s registered identification number and may be referred to as the burned-in address. It may also be known as an Ethernet hardware address (EHA), hardware address or physical address. A network node may have multiple NICs and will then have one unique MAC address per NIC.”</p><p><strong>Sniffing</strong>: (from<strong>Wikipedia)</strong> “A packet analyzer (also known as a network analyzer, protocol analyzer or packet sniffer, or for particular types of networks, an Ethernet sniffer or wireless sniffer) is a computer program or a piece of computer hardware that can intercept and log traffic passing over a digital network or part of a network. As data streams flow across the network, the sniffer captures each packet and, if needed, decodes the packet’s raw data, showing the values of various fields in the packet, and analyzes its content according to the appropriate RFC or other specifications.”</p><p><strong>ARP</strong>(from <strong>Wikipedia)</strong> “Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a telecommunications protocol used for resolution of network layer addresses into link layer addresses, a critical function in multiple-access networks. ARP was defined by RFC 826 in 1982. It is Internet Standard STD 37. It is also the name of the program for manipulating these addresses in most operating systems.”</p><h2>Usage</h2><p>Now after launching the application, we have to configure it to use appropriate network card.If you have multiple network cards, it’s better to know the MAC address of the network card that you will use for the sniffer.To get the MAC address of your network interface card, do the following:</p><p>1- Open CMD prompt.<br>/p&gt;</p><p>2- Write the following command “ipconfig /all”.</p><p>3- Determine the MAC address of the desired Ethernet adapters, write it on Notepad,and then use this information to help determine which NIC to select in the Cain application.</p><p>Now clickConfigure on the main menu. It will open the configuration dialog box where you can select the desired network interface card.</p><p>Now let’s go through the configuration dialog tabs and take a brief look at most of them:</p><h3>Sniffer Tab:</h3><img src='https://image.slidesharecdn.com/chapter10wirelesshackingcompatibilitymode-160420123723/95/chapter-10-wireless-hacking-compatibility-mode-23-638.jpg?cb=1461155940' alt='Wireless' title='Wireless'><p>This tab allows us to specify which Ethernet interface card we will use for sniffing.</p><h3>ARP Tab:</h3><p>This tab allows us to configure ARP poison routing to perform ARP poisoning attack, which tricks the victim’s computer by impersonating other devices to get all traffic that belongs to that device, which is usually the router or an important server.</p><h3>Filters and Ports Tab:</h3><p>This tab has the most standard services with their default port running on.You can change the port by right-clicking on the service whose port you want to change and then enabling or disabling it.</p><p>Cain’s sniffer filters and application protocol TCP/UDP port.</p><h3>HTTP Fields Tab:</h3><p>There are some features of Cain that parse information from web pages viewed by the victim such as LSA Secrets dumper, HTTP Sniffer and ARP-HTTPS,so the more fields you add to the username and passwords fields, the more you capture HTTP usernames and passwords from HTTP and HTTPS requests. Here is an example:</p><p>The following cookie uses the fields “logonusername=” and “userpassword=” for authentication purposes. If you don’t include these two fields in the list, the sniffer will not extract relative credentials.</p><p><span>GET /mail/Login?domain=xxxxxx.xx&amp;style=default&amp;plain=0 HTTP/1.1<span><br></span></span></p><p><span>Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, application/vnd.ms-excel, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint, application/msword, application/x-shockwave-flash, */*<span><br></span></span></p><p><span>Referer: http://xxx.xxxxxxx.xx/xxxxx/xxxx<span><br></span></span></p><img src='https://media.ldscdn.org/images/media-library/old-testament-seminary-curriculum-images/cain-abel-barrett-staff-lamb-166569-tablet.jpg?download=true' alt='And' title='And'><p><span>Accept-Language: it<span><br></span></span></p><p><span>Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate<span><br></span></span></p><p><span>User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; (R1 1.3); .NET CLR 1.1.4322)<span><br></span></span></p><p><span>Host: xxx.xxxxxx.xx<span><br></span></span></p><p><span>Connection: Keep-Alive<span><br></span></span></p><p><span>Cookie: ss=1; <strong>logonusername=user@xxxxxx.xx</strong>; ss=1; srclng=it; srcdmn=it; srctrg=_blank; srcbld=y; srcauto=on; srcclp=on; srcsct=web; <strong>userpassword=password</strong>; video=c1; TEMPLATE=default;<span><br></span></span></p><h3>Traceroute Tab:</h3><p>Traceroute is a technique to determine the path between two points by simply counting how many hops the packet will take from the source machine to reach the destination machine. Cain also adds more functionality that allows hostname resolution, Net mask resolution, and Whois information gathering.</p><h3>Certificate Spoofing Tab:</h3><p>This tab will allow Certificate spoofing.From Wikipedia: <a href='/solitude-standing-suzanne-vega-rar-file.html'>Solitude standing suzanne vega rar file</a>.</p><p>“In cryptography, a public key certificate (also known as a digital certificate or identity certificate) is an electronic document that uses a digital signature to bind a public key with an identity — information such as the name of a person or an organization, their address, and so forth. The certificate can be used to verify that a public key belongs to an individual.</p><p>In a typical public key infrastructure (PKI) scheme, the signature will be of a certificate authority (CA). In a web of trust scheme, the signature is of either the user (a self-signed certificate) or other users (“endorsements”). In either case, the signatures on a certificate are attestations by the certificate signer that the identity information and the public key belong together.”</p><p>We can simply think of it as some sort of data (cipher suites &amp; Public key and some other information about the owner of the certificate) that has information about the destination server and is encrypted by trusted companies (CA) that are authorized for creating these types of data.The server sends its own certificate to the client application to make sure it’s talking to the right server.</p><h3>Certificate Collector Tab:</h3><p>This tab will collect all certificates back and forth between servers and clients by setting proxy IPs and ports that listen to it.</p><h3>Challenge Spoofing Tab:</h3><img src='https://www.top-password.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Cain-Abel-NTLM.png' alt='And' title='And'><p>Here you can set the custom challenge value to rewrite into NTLM authentications packets. This feature can be enabled quickly from Cain’s toolbar and must be used with APR. A fixed challenge enables cracking of NTLM hashes captured on the network by means of Rainbow Tables.</p><h3>Password Cracking</h3><p>Now it’s time to speak about the cracker tab,the most important feature of Cain.When Cain captures some LM and NTLM hashes or any kind of passwords for any supported protocols, Cain sends them automatically to the Cracker tab.We will import a local SAM file just for demonstration purposes to illustrate this point.Here is how to import the SAM file:</p><p>Here are the 4 NTLM and LM hashes which will appear like the following image:</p><p>And here you will find all possible password techniques in the following image:</p><p>As you can see from the previous image, there are various types of techniques that are very effective in password cracking.We will look at each of their definitions.</p><h3>Dictionary attack:</h3><p><strong>From Wikipedia: “</strong>A dictionary attack uses a targeted technique of successively trying all the words in an exhaustive list called a dictionary (from a pre-arranged list of values). In contrast with a brute force attack, where a large proportion key space is searched systematically, a dictionary attack tries only those possibilities which are most likely to succeed, typically derived from a list of words for example a dictionary (hence the phrase dictionary attack). Generally, dictionary attacks succeed because many people have a tendency to choose passwords which are short (7 characters or fewer), single words found in dictionaries or simple, easily predicted variations on words, such as appending a digit. However these are easy to defeat. Adding a single random character in the middle can make dictionary attacks untenable.”</p><h3>Brute forcing attack:</h3><p><strong>From Wikipedia: “</strong>In cryptography, a brute-force attack, or exhaustive key search, is a cryptanalytic attack that can, in theory, be used against any encrypted data (except for data encrypted in an information-theoretically secure manner). Such an attack might be utilized when it is not possible to take advantage of other weaknesses in an encryption system (if any exist) that would make the task easier. It consists of systematically checking all possible keys until the correct key is found. In the worst case, this would involve traversing the entire search space.</p><p>The key length used in the cipher determines the practical feasibility of performing a brute-force attack, with longer keys exponentially more difficult to crack than shorter ones. A cipher with a key length of<em> N</em> bits can be broken in a worst-case time proportional to 2<span><em>N</em></span> and an average time of half that. Brute-force attacks can be made less effective by obfuscating the data to be encoded, something that makes it more difficult for an attacker to recognize when he/she has cracked the code. One of the measures of the strength of an encryption system is how long it would theoretically take an attacker to mount a successful brute-force attack against it.”</p><h3>Cryptanalysis attack (Using Rainbow Table):</h3><p><strong>From Wikipedia: “</strong>A rainbow table is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, usually for cracking password hashes. Tables are usually used in recovering the plain text password, up to a certain length consisting of a limited set of characters. It is a practical example of a space-time tradeoff, using more computer processing time at the cost of less storage when calculating a hash on every attempt, or less processing time and more storage when compared to a simple lookup table with one entry per hash. Use of a key derivation function that employ a salt makes this attack infeasible. Rainbow tables are a refinement of an earlier, simpler algorithm by Martin Hellman.”</p><h2>How To Make A Rainbow Table?</h2><p>There are many tools that create a rainbow table and there are many rainbow tables already available on the internet.Fortunately, Cain comes with a tool called winrtgen, which is located in its own folder in the installation.</p><p>You will need to choose ahash algorithm, minimum andmaximum length of password, and finally the charset that the password will use.Then press OK.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Cain and Abel is a powerful tool that does a great job in password cracking. It can crack almost all kinds of passwords, and it’s usually just a matter of time before you get it.</p><h3>References</h3><p>1- <span>www.wikipedia.org</span></p><p>2- <span>www.oxid.it</span></p><p>3- <span>www.thehackerslibrary.com</span></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>There’s something that just feels right about being an information security professional in a large urban city. Considering the mess of unsecured IoT devices, sloppily configured home networks, and bad business practices, a pentester with authorization might just be the king of the jungle. On days like this, I feel a calling…a calling for wardriving. What is wardriving? Wikipedia defines it as, “the act of searching for Wi-Fi wireless networks by a person usually in a moving vehicle, using a laptop or smartphone.” I call it 'mobile hunting'.</p><p>Back in the days of yore, there were far more WEP access points out there in the wild. In Seattle, Washington in 2004, a weeks-long analysis of the city found 5,225 access points, and of those 5,255, only 44% of the routers were secured with WEP encryption. (http://old.seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2002183464_wifimap18.html)<br>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving)</p><p>To compare, I did the same thing in Grand Rapids, Michigan in May 2018. I found roughly 3,000 access points, only two of which used WEP encryption. While this is a good sign for the state of information security, it’s frustrating for us blackhat wardrivers.</p><p>So what does this mean? Well, largely it means we’ve progressed to more secure standards like WPA2, but could those be cracked? Or, alternatively, are the seldom pickings of WEP networks plentiful enough nowadays to sustain a wardriving habit?</p><p>In short, yes, and yes. We’ll be addressing the cracking of WPA2 a little later, but as far as cracking WEP goes, it’s still definitely worthwhile to have in one’s pentesting repertoire. Plus, if you get some practice wardriving for WEP, you can easily adapt that skillset to progress into WPA2 cracking.</p><p><strong>Tools</strong></p><p>To prepare for our warpath, we’ll only need one thing: a wardriving application. The point of any wardriving application is to continually scan for networks on a given channel and then log the encryption standard, location, and MAC &amp; SSID for later use.</p><p>That’s not actually a terribly demanding list of features, so there’s plenty of open-source applications ready to choose from that come equipped. My personal favorites as an Android user are WiGLE WiFi and GMON, but WiGLE gets precedence and all of my respect for running https://wigle.net/, a crowdsourced map of wifi access points (which some might argue is the terminal goal of wardriving).</p><p>Once I installed WiGLE WiFi on my Android, I opened up the app and immediately got hits. I wouldn’t even be off work yet for a few hours; but I was itching to roam and collect more networks for my log.</p><p>You’ll immediately see a nice enough (free!) interface which displays the SSID (Router Name), MAC Address, Signal Strength, and Encryption Standard.</p><p><strong>Exporting</strong></p><p>One of the features any wardriving app worth half it’s salt will have is an Export to File option; probably in CSV or KML format.</p><p>Personally, I think it’s amazing to be able to build a database of access points, or “APs,” and view them easily by location. Sites like http://kmlviewer.nsspot.net/ can provide a quick and free way to browse a collection, though there are plenty of alternatives. I like KMLViewer because it visualizes with color coding the encryption standard present - which makes parsing through data in a big city much easier.</p><p>Once accumulating APs with WEP, WPS or WPA/WPA2 encryption, it’s easy to recall / view the location later; and if authorization from the owner is negotiated, return later in a clandestine operation to perform a realistic curbside security audit.</p><p>Over time, as WPA and WPA2 replaced the deprecated and insecure WEP standard, home networks for computer users with little to no expertise in the field were automatically secured by the default WPA2 configuration on nearly all routers available for purchase. While this is good for the average home user, it’s less than ideal for people who make their livings on poorly secured technology.</p><h2 id='wpa2-encryption-key'>Wpa2 Encryption Key</h2><p>That being said, the art of wardriving truly is a joyful, lighthearted and fun activity that I strongly encourage anyone interested in cybersecurity to experience firsthand. As mentioned previously, not only will this hone a useful skill, but it will also posture anyone to transition into WPA2 handshake capturing and cracking with a comprehensive understanding.</p><p>It’s also well worth noting that wardriving for WEPs is not without benefit to a true threat actor. The act of “warkitting” refers to roaming in a wardriving style, but upon completion of the WEP crack, using the key to access the AP without authorization and proceeding to “update” the AP to use malicious firmware that rootkits the router, to add it to a botnet.</p><p><strong>WEP Cracking</strong></p><p>Alright, we’re finally ready to perform a WEP cracking attack, which should obviously only be performed on a computer system the cracker is authorized to pentest. There’s a wide range of tools for a crack on this encryption type, one consequence of the standard’s deprecation. I prefer Aircrack-ng, since I’m already used to the syntax of Airmon and Airodump from my blackhat Pi build.</p><p>Honorable mentions: Reaver (WPA), FERN Wifi Cracker (WEP/WPA), Cain &amp; Abel (WEP), and Wifiphisher (not technically a “cracker”, but still worth mentioning; (WEP/WPA/WPA2)).</p><p>First we’ll need to get the name of our wireless adapter (or interface, in Linux terminology). In Linux, this is as simple as checking the “iwconfig” command output.</p><p>It should return something like:</p><p>with a ton of useful text about this interface’s characteristics to the right of it. Sometimes it’ll be wlan1, or a different name altogether, so this might take a bit of trial and error.</p><p>Next, we need to start our interface in monitor mode; which is when the adapter will constantly scan a channel with packet capturing capability. The command to do that should look like this</p><p>Most of the time the channel will be 11 in my experience; but again, this may vary.</p><img src='https://www.evanscenter.com/Cain.jpg' alt='Encryption' title='Encryption'><p>It’s good practice to check that this change succeeded by again using the “iwconfig” command. If successful, you should have a new interface on monitor mode; which usually looks like:</p><p>Awesome! Next we’ll want to start capturing traffic. That’s as easy as entering:</p><p>The screen will start to populate with the APs, including the SSID, PWR (Signal Strength), CH (Channel), ENC (Encryption Type), and MAC Address.</p><p>Next we’ll want to specifically target our dummy WEP encrypted AP and capture some packets.</p><p>Name the file something memorable, because we’ll need to access this later to actually run the cracking half of the lab.</p><p>This will begin our packet capturing process. Now we wait to see if anyone connects to the AP while we’re actively capturing packets from it. Some of these packets will include a “networking handshake” to establish a new device and introduce it to the access point. By spying on packets, we’ll easily tell when someone does this.</p><p>Once you see a second BSSID populate below the first, which depicts the AP, that's a sure sign of somebody connecting to the AP. (Our screen will look a little different than the screenshot, which appears to be running with a slightly different configuration.)</p><p><strong>Initialization Vectors &amp; You</strong></p><p>From here, we could just let our packet capturing naturally, over a long slow period of time, collect samples of initialization vectors, or IVs, and analyze them in order to accurately guess the key.</p><p>Each time a packet is sent; it requires a new IV be sent along with it, which is used like a salt would be used to add complexity to a password hash -- that is, the secret key of the WEP network is made more complex by adding a random, new, IV with each transmission of a packet. The intended effect of this is to prevent us from succeeding in guessing the secret key by examining a single IV.</p><p>In practice, that means a key like “bo0kw0rm” might be “salted” so to speak with an IV of “rld” or “vbn”, just a random 3 byte string; and end up looking more like “rldbo0kw0rm” or “vbnbo0kw0rm”.</p><p>While the original key, or “pre-shared key (PSK)” is the original word input (bo0kw0rm), the “secret key”, or string used to encrypt a communication via packets, is the concatenated version, “vbnbo0kw0rm”.</p><p>The flaw with WEP initialization vectors is that each IV is only 3 bytes long; which means the list of possible IVs is actually quite small considering the traffic that a busy network might undergo and the ability of threat actors to examine IV usage.</p><p>As a result, when you have enough time to sniff packets until an IV is inevitably re-used; then it becomes quite simple to segregate the IV from the key, based on probability that segment A of the full string (which is the IV plus key) is an IV, and segment B is the key.</p><p>When we have a good guess for what the key might be; we check it against the list of IVs captured and see if concating our guessed key with any or all of the historical IVs results in a previously used string in the list. If so, that means we’ve successfully “cracked” the key.</p><p>As a side note here; we’re able to initially obtain the MAC Address of the device we’re posing as to the router because the header and footers in a packet are NOT encrypted; and the header will always contain the MAC address of the device the packet originated from.</p><p><strong>A Little Bit of History</strong></p><p>The only problem with this technique as it stands is that a typical passive WEP key sniffing attack would take 5-6 hours on a very busy network for enough packets to be communicated to in turn generate the necessary amount of IVs to analyze in order for Aircrack to properly guess the key.</p><p>Yahoo web <a href='/bst-ekr-1000-web-guide-manual.html' title='guide'>guide</a>. Enter “Korek,” a gifted hacker who devised a revolutionary method of WEP cracking, which at its core relies on injecting packets into the access point arbitrarily and rapidly, to generate packet noise and in turn generate far more IVs to be analyzed. This immediately broke the security of WEP, as now the same attack, with Korek’s method applied, would typically crack the same complexity of key in a matter of minutes.</p><p>Korek’s method is now immortalized, probably, in the aireplay-ng module of Aircrack-ng, which does exactly as he intended and injects packets into the router until we have enough IVs to get the key.</p><p><strong>WEP Cracking, the Finale</strong></p><p>To use the airplay-ng module; use the following command:</p><p>The -b and -h options are commanding aireplay-ng to use the given MAC address as our source MAC address, effectively spoofing it during/for the injection.</p><h2 id='cain-and-abel-wifi-cracker'>Cain And Abel Wifi Cracker</h2><p>For the curious, the -3 option specifies our attack mode; which is ARP request replay. I think aircrack-ng’s own website, https://www.aircrack-ng.org explains better than I could:</p><p>The program listens for an ARP packet then retransmits it back to the access point. This, in turn, causes the access point to repeat the ARP packet with a new IV. The program retransmits the same ARP packet over and over. However, each ARP packet repeated by the access point has a new IVs. It is all these new IVs which allow you to determine the WEP key.</p><p>Now all we have to do is wait until we’ve collected a few thousands IVs in our crack file from earlier. So do so; just use the command:</p><p><strong>Finding Keys</strong></p><p>If we recovered enough IV samples; aircrack should print, “Key found” or something to that effect, along with the key. If not, you’ll want to return to the earlier steps and collect more IVs, retrying the crack in increments.</p><h2 id='cain-and-abel-crack-wpa2-encryption-download'>Cain And Abel Crack Wpa2 Encryption Download</h2><p>The key will appear in hexdecimal format, so you can use the key as it is, but also convert it from hexdecimal to text with an online converter like http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/hexadecimal/. This should yield a passphrase in plain text, which may be useful for further pentesting.</p><h2 id='breaking-wpa2-encryption'>Breaking Wpa2 Encryption</h2><p>Well, that’s pretty much it. We’ve covered wardriving as a concept, how to put that concept into practice today, and why you should. We’ve addressed why identifying WEP networks as vulnerable is useful and even benevolent, as well as demonstrated how to perform an actual WEP security audit with some lightweight, open source Linux tools (-- the best kind!).</p><p>This is part one of a two-part series on wardriving’s evolution. We touched briefly on the WPA2 wireless security encryption standard in this paper, but next I’ll be delving deep into how to capture an encrypted WPA2 “handshake” and use it to gain access to a modern, secure network.</p><h2 id='enable-wpa2-encryption'>Enable Wpa2 Encryption</h2><p>Stay tuned!</p></div><footer class="md-post-panel"></footer></article><nav role="navigation" id="list-extra-top" class="bar-top-md"><h1 class="panel-site-primary">Post navigation</h1><div class="fix nav-extra-primary"><a href="/nishiki-serial-number-location.html">Nishiki Serial Number Location</a></div><div class="navigation-aside-secondary fix"><a href="/khatu-shyam-baba-bhajan-mp3-free-download.html">Khatu Shyam Baba Bhajan Mp3 Free Download</a></div></nav></main></div><div id="static-label-area" class="panel-default-page clear page-clear-md" role="complementary"><aside id="sm-row-label" class="layout-md-fn post-box-item"><div class="sm-row-label-inner-block"><form role="search" method="get" class="layout-item-single page-block-layout" action="#"><label><span class="panel-site-primary">Search for:</span><input type="search" class="sm-layout-node" placeholder="Search &hellip;" value="" name="s"></label><input type="submit" class="label-abbr-fix" value="Search"></form></div></aside><aside id="aside-clear-main" class="md-label-area post-box-item"><div class="aside-clear-main-inner-block"><h1 class="fix-aside-entry">Recent News</h1><ul>&#167; <a href='/sanyo-golf-cart-repair-manual.html'>Sanyo Golf Cart Repair Manual</a></ul><ul>&#167; <a href='/emperor-of-mankind-vs-horus.html'>Emperor Of Mankind Vs Horus</a></ul><ul>&#167; <a href='/sally-face-complete-game-for-mac.html'>Sally Face - COMPLETE GAME For Mac</a></ul><ul>&#167; <a href='/escape-from-tethys-crack.html'>Escape From Tethys Crack</a></ul><ul>&#167; <a href='/the-bards-tale-trilogy-crack.html'>The Bard's Tale Trilogy Crack</a></ul><ul>&#167; <a href='/sumeru-art-book-download-for-mac.html'>Sumeru Art Book Download For Mac</a></ul><ul>&#167; <a href='/colortone-download-for-mac.html'>Colortone Download For Mac</a></ul></div></aside></div></div><footer id="col-md-body" class="container-lg-layout layout-item-single copy-md-default" role="contentinfo"><div id="layout-fn-singular" class="static-panel-abbr solid"><div class="layout-fn-singular-inner-block"></div></div><div class="node-layer-fn default-layer-panel"><div class="node-layer-fn-inner-block"><a href="/" title="chancdenthera1973.github.io">chancdenthera1973.github.io</a></div></div></footer></div></body></html>
